# Grace Petclinic Sample Application

This is the standard introductory sample application for Grace. To get started with it, simply clone the repository and then from within your local copy run:

    ./gradlew bootRun

on Unix-like systems, or

    gradlew bootRun

on Windows via the command prompt. Once the server has started up, you can copy the URL and paste it in a browser.
